Hello and welcome 👋 to our support platform for threat intelligence signals sharing.

The TIS archive is created under the assistance of the European Commission-EU DIGITAL EUROPE 🇪🇺 programme, collecting full killchains of known tactics, techniques and procedures seen in the wild. The killchains are particularly useful for training exercises such at [tabletop exercises](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity-Tabletop-Exercise-Tips_508c.pdf), where participants from multiple teams in the organisation collaborate on a virtual situation.

The archives are available at a different web site, please open an issue if you need access for research and defense purposes.

## Submission guidelines

New killchains are always welcomed to the archive.

For confidentiality and IP reasons, we do not accept recording or artifacts without clear provenance: instead, a synthetic environment should be created, the attack performed on this environment, and the artifacts collected during the reproduction. Artifacts must be shared under a Creative Commons - Attribution license, including code and documentation.

If you want to contribute, please open an issue in the issue tracker with our “killchain submission” template.
Then submit a PR with the artifacts required to reproduce the killchain (including scripts, configuration templates, …). We will then provide you with a link to upload the resulting artifacts.
