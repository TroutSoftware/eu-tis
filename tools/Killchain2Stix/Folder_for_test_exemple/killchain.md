|  Initial Access | T0819 | Exploit Public-Facing Application | Avalanche is commonly exposed via web interfaces; unauthenticated attackers could exploit these path traversal flaws directly. |
| Persistence | T0859 | Valid Accounts | If sensitive credentials are extracted via traversal, attacker could create persistent admin sessions. |
| Discovery | T0846 | Remote System Discovery | Once internal files are exposed, attackers may enumerate systems, devices and networks. |
| Impact | T0826 / T0827 | Loss of availability / Loss of control | Sensitive leakage or configuration tampering could affect MDM functionality or operational environments. |
